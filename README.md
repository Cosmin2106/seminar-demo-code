##### Demo Code for *C++: discovering and teaching modern C++20 programming* seminar (TUM)

In this repository I have gathered all the examples shown during the presentation and then some. All snippets are accompanied by comments and explanations. Feel free to use these templates however you like.

## Setup

You will need:
- a Linux machine
- CMAKE 3.16 or newer

After the environment is set up, execute the **main.cpp** file.
